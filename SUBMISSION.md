# KIRCHHOFF submission (TOKEN2049 Origins)

Status as of 2026-10-06. Deadline: 11:59 pm, October 7, 2026. Every demo element is a **Testnet simulation**.
Requirement-level detail: [PRD_TRACEABILITY.md](PRD_TRACEABILITY.md).

## Submission checklist (PRD section 15)

| # | Item | Status | Evidence / what remains |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Public GitHub repo with README, architecture diagram, deployed addresses per chain, CRE workflow ids, and how to reproduce the Kelp Replay | DONE | Public at https://github.com/Adwaitbytes/kirchhoff-ccv with CI green ([run on 36e1767](https://github.com/Adwaitbytes/kirchhoff-ccv/actions)). [README.md](README.md) has the diagram, the hackathon-window deployment with all 26 contracts source-verified on 3 testnets, a passing testnet Kelp Replay with every transaction linked, workflow names and simulation ids, and local and testnet replay steps. Live DON workflow ids do not exist: CRE deploy access was requested and the Chainlink track lead confirmed simulation is sufficient for judging |
| 2 | Live URL: public Mission Control in read-only mode with a "Replay last incident" timeline | DONE | https://kirchhoff-two.vercel.app (read-only, Replay last incident player) and API https://kirchhoff-api.vercel.app, both Vercel `sin1`, mirroring the hackathon-window ledgers through a continuously running indexer |
| 3 | Deck uploaded to Google Drive as .pptx with the video embedded | PENDING | Deferred by product owner. The 8-slide deck and its generator exist (`media/deck/KIRCHHOFF.pptx`, `media/deck/build.cjs`); slide 4 shows a placeholder until the video exists. Not uploaded |
| 4 | Main track plus Chainlink track submissions, with a paragraph on exactly how CRE and CCIP are used | PENDING | Paragraphs drafted below |
| 5 | Submitted before 11:59 pm on October 7 | PENDING | Human task |

## Recording checklist (PRD section 15)

| # | Item | Status | Evidence / what remains |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `demo/reset.ts` restores all three chains to a clean, conserved state in under 3 minutes | DONE | 28.2 s on three local chains ([demo/E2E_LOG.md](demo/E2E_LOG.md)); on public testnets the same reset takes about 25 minutes because RECOVERY_CHECK reads finalized blocks |
| 2 | At least three full takes; keep the best one unedited apart from trimming | PENDING | Deferred by product owner (video) |
| 3 | Explorer tabs pre-opened for each transaction; clock and timestamps visible | PENDING | Deferred by product owner (video). Every demo step emits its explorer link (`demo/src/attack.ts`, `demo/src/ccip.ts`) |
| 4 | A second machine records a backup take in parallel | PENDING | Deferred by product owner (video); human task |

## Chainlink track: how we use CRE and CCIP

KIRCHHOFF is an economic Cross-Chain Verifier: it refuses a transfer when a token's supply stops adding up across
chains. The Conservation Engine is four TypeScript CRE workflows (`@chainlink/cre-sdk` 1.23.0). W1 Junction Watch
fires on an EVM Log trigger for every bridge credit, pins the claimed source chain with `headerByNumber`
(finalized), confirms the debit with `callContract` at that block, attaches `filterLogs` evidence, and if no debit
exists writes a BREACH report to the ConservationLedger on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Base Sepolia in the same run via
`writeReport` and the KeystoneForwarder. W2 Loop Ledger runs on a 30 second cron plus supply log triggers, makes one
Multicall3 `callContract` per chain at pinned blocks and writes signed EPOCH reports with Δ. W3 Responder triggers
on `BreachRecorded`, writes QUARANTINE_APPLIED and pages through the HTTP capability with CRE secrets. W4 watches
`SpecActivated` and minter grants. Our ledgers inherit the ReceiverTemplate pattern and accept only allowlisted
workflows. On CCIP 2.0, kETH is a Cross-Chain Token whose CCIP 2.0.0 pools enforce the ledger status in
`lockOrBurn` / `releaseOrMint` (Fallback B, live), and our Judge is the policy hook of a CCV Starter Kit cell. Honest
status: CRE deploy access was requested and the Chainlink track lead confirmed simulation is sufficient for judging, so
workflows run with `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` and write real reports on the three testnets; our CCV is not yet
onboarded for live attestation, so Fallback B enforces on the CCIP lanes.

## Main track summary

Every bridge checks who signed. KIRCHHOFF checks if the money adds up. In April 2026 one forged message released
about $292M of rsETH from a bridge configured with a single verifier, and holders on 20 chains lost value. A simple
sum would have caught it. KIRCHHOFF enforces two rules borrowed from Kirchhoff's circuit laws: every credit on any
chain must match a finalized debit with the same message id, amount and recipient (Junction Rule), and backing must
cover every claim across all chains and bridges (Loop Rule). The rules live in one deterministic engine shared by
Chainlink CRE workflows, a CCIP 2.0 CCV policy hook and a backtester, so they always agree, and AI never sits in the
veto path. When the Kelp pattern is replayed on our Testnet simulation, the breach is written to all three ledgers
in the same CRE run, CCIP lanes freeze, the attacker's tokens cannot move, and a lending market refuses to lend
against them. Mission Control shows it as a circuit that turns red; an AI Incident Narrator explains it with
citations; agents query it through MCP before moving funds.

## Judging weights mapped to evidence

| Criterion (weight) | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Functionality (30%) | 150 Foundry tests, 494 TypeScript tests and 124 Playwright tests passing (CI run 37393797827 on `6ad7ab8`; local Playwright report 2026-10-06); six PRD scenarios plus the latency run pass through `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` on 3 chains, and W2 writes EPOCH, Loop BREACH and RECOVERY_CHECK on the 3 public testnets (`workflows/SIMULATION_LOG.md`, `demo/logs/`); full contract suite deployed and source-verified on 3 testnets with kETH registered as a CCIP Cross-Chain Token. A full `demo e2e --network testnet` run passed on the hackathon-window deployment (README "Testnet transactions"); full-history backtest of that deployment flags all 5 forged credits with 0 false BROKEN ([docs/BACKTEST_TESTNET.md](docs/BACKTEST_TESTNET.md)) |
| Technical implementation (25%) | Engine at 100% branch coverage (764/764, 328 tests); Judge p99 9.31 ms at 100 rps against real contracts and two providers (judge/load/RESULTS.md run D) with a 10,000-run property test; four CRE workflows inside the 15-read / 100-block per-run limits; Judge built to the chainlink-ccv OpenAPI spec with HMAC, two-provider agreement and a 2 s budget; CCIP 2.0.0 pool subclasses; real KeystoneForwarder signature path tested |
| Innovation (20%) | We found no public CCV that checks economic conservation; KIRCHHOFF verifies whether a message is economically possible, across bridges it does not sit on, and uses the CCV slot CCIP 2.0 opened on September 28 |
| Usefulness (15%) | Additive to the Committee Verifier; AggregatorV3-compatible Conservation Feed that lending markets read (`DemoLendingMarket` freezes borrowing); REST, SDK and MCP for apps and agents; Spec Copilot onboards kETH on testnet in 111.6 s with 49/49 fields (ai/eval/TESTNET_ONBOARDING.md; eval: 100% provenance, 0 of 10 injection misuse) |
| Demo (10%) | Attack Lab plus stage mode (`?stage=1`, 1920x1080) with Playwright stage snapshots in dark and light; live read-only Mission Control at https://kirchhoff-two.vercel.app; 8-slide deck generated. Recording deferred by product owner |
